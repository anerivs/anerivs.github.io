## Who I am

Hi! my name is Aneri Shah. I'm an aspiring software engineer with a focus in AI/ML engineering, quantum computing, and low-level programming.

## Academic Background

I am a third-year student at New York University studying computer science, physics, and Japanese (rare combo, I know). At NYU, I lead the software development for our Motorsports FSAE team, where we are designing an electric racecar. We started last year, and we're expected to release an operating car by Spring 2025! Additionally, I am a marketing director for our Women in Computing team. It's extremely important to me that women reach the same successes as men in the tech field, and I help achieve this goal by creating social media posts and organizing office tours and workshops. 

I went to high school at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology.
